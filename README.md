## Plan to implement Token - gating Bot / SDK or Component

- The bot must be able to verify the ownership of a user's tokens or NFTs.
- The bot must be able to grant or restrict access to a webpage based on the ownership verification.
- The bot must be easy to install and set up for website owners.
- The bot should be built for Ethereum or Polygon.
- The bot should be able to integrate with different types of wallets.
- The bot should have an interface for website owners to configure and set up.
- Make sure to use the Alchemy NFT API and Token API
- Write thorough documentation on how you built this.

- We'll go with SDK approach and create a UI element for the admin:

## FINAL APPROACH

- React Component can be created which can be used in React and Next Application

- We can Wrap the component to the whole app , which check the current url and restricts the entry

- The Selection of URL would be done via a public - private route constants

- To implement the kind of check , we need to create a methods , like NFT or TOKEN addresses and the conditions for gating the access

Or Create a full scale data base , to check the URL and assign the conditions

- The wallet connection will be handeled by Rainbow wallet with multiple options , with ETH and Polygon as the networks

## LAYDOWN

- The best way is creating a database that can be called with to check the access , simply supplying the URL and the user Address and handling it all on the backend side
- Interface for controlling the websites pages for admin
- Wrapper to just simply check the access of the page , and allow to go ahead if authorised to be
- For page navigation, we need to find a good solution , maybe window.href or React Router
